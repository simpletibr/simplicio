# Simplicio public plugins and host integrations

This repository publishes one Simplicio package through native Codex and Claude
Code marketplaces, the portable Agent Plugins v1 contract, and a Gemini CLI
extension. Hosts without a verified plugin API use the Runtime-owned MCP/config
integration instead of an invented plugin format.

The official `install.sh` and `install.ps1` install the verified Runtime and
register only the host surfaces supported by that Runtime. Marketplace plugin
updates remain an explicit host action: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor,
Copilot, Qwen, Kiro, and Hermes are never mutated by a shell installer without
their own host update/consent flow.

## Install in Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add simpletibr/simplicio --ref master
codex plugin add simplicio@simplicio-codex
```

Start a new Codex task after installation. The plugin's MCP bootstrap then
reuses a compatible Simplicio Runtime or installs the pinned, verified Runtime
release and starts its complete stdio MCP surface. `simplicio_exec` exposes
every valid CLI subcommand, while the Runtime publishes its dedicated tools
dynamically. Authentication remains explicit; installation never logs in on
the user's behalf.

The Codex package, including its official Simplicio logo, lives at
[`plugins/simplicio`](plugins/simplicio).

## Install as an Agent Plugin

The portable package at `plugins/simplicio` contains the Agent Plugins v1
`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, and shared `skills/`. Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
Kiro, and Qwen Code can consume this format according to their own install UI or
CLI.

For a local checkout, select or install:

```text
./plugins/simplicio
```

## Install in Gemini CLI

Install the repository checkout's package directory:

```bash
gemini extensions install ./plugins/simplicio
```

The native `gemini-extension.json` starts the same verified bootstrap and
Gemini discovers the bundled skills.

## Install in Claude Code

In Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add simpletibr/simplicio
/plugin install simplicio@simplicio
```

The main `simplicio` package bootstraps the verified Runtime automatically and
installs mandatory Mapper-only Claude hooks. Complete Runtime installation before login, restart Claude after registration, and make a harmless first Mapper/MCP call before project work. The hooks keep the project map in
`.simplicio/hook-context/`, reuse it while the project generation is unchanged,
and refresh it after a visible project change. They call the Runtime map
operation first and use the bundled Mapper fallback already maintained inside
the Simplicio-managed `.simplicio` state if Runtime mapping fails. Fast and
other context accelerators are consultation-only; they are not lifecycle
dependencies. Hooks never download, install, or expose a second context
pipeline. If both Mapper paths fail, the host request is denied.

The separate `simplicio-loop`, `simplicio-prompt`, and `simplicio-hermes`
packages remain available for explicit workflows and their
respective hosts. Install `simplicio-loop` only when the Loop orchestration
surface is intentionally needed.

### Updating an existing installation

Update the Simplicio Runtime with the normal installer, refresh the Claude
marketplace entry and update/reinstall `simplicio`, or reinstall Hermes with
`--force --enable`. Start a new host session after the update. Existing
`.simplicio` data is preserved; each Claude/Hermes lifecycle event then
revalidates the project generation and refreshes or reuses the Mapper cache.

## Published components

| Plugin | Owns | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `simplicio` (Codex, Claude, Agent Plugins v1, Gemini) | Verified Runtime bootstrap, complete live MCP surface, shared skills, and Runtime-managed pre-hooks | This repository |
| `simplicio-loop` | Loop, tasks alias, orient, review, compress, learn, autoresearch, Prism, Mapper, Fast, Dev CLI, Runtime skills and safety hooks | [`simplicio-loop`](https://github.com/simpletibr/simplicio-loop) |
| `simplicio-prompt` | Tuple-Space/Yool prompt contract, fan-out commands, and opt-in prompt adapter | [`simplicio-prompt`](https://github.com/simpletibr/simplicio-prompt) |
| `simplicio-hermes` | Native `pre_llm_call` context preparation and post-call Runtime receipts for Hermes Agent | This repository |

The main `simplicio` plugin is the default integration entry point.
The Loop plugin remains available for explicit orchestration workflows. Prompt
remains a separate installable plugin so its hooks and commands do not create
duplicate runtime activation or hidden provider calls.

## Verification

```bash
simplicio plugin list --json
simplicio-plugins --json
simplicio self-test --json
simplicio contracts smoke --json
```

The plugin bundles are MIT-licensed within their plugin directories. The root
Runtime distribution and its release artifacts retain their repository license.

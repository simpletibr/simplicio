# Update signature contract

This document records the trust contract shared by the compiled Runtime and
the public bootstrap installers. It exists to prevent a future release from
being published with a signature that the installer cannot validate.

## Canonical payload

For an artifact digest `D`, where `D` is the lowercase 64-character SHA-256
hex string, Runtime `simplicio update sign D` signs the UTF-8 bytes of:

```text
simplicio-release-v1:D
```

The signature is published as `ed25519:<base64-signature>` in both the artifact
sidecar (`<artifact>.sig`) and the corresponding manifest entry. The manifest must publish the root `signing_pubkey` field. Stable releases accept exactly
`t9n5AmQT2VUVR4LJ0mjQ07C0lEPIMG7oCJGc/5kR4/U=`, which is the key compiled into the
Runtime and pinned by both installers.

## Verification order

Every installer must:

1. download the immutable release manifest and artifact;
2. compare the artifact SHA-256 with the manifest;
3. verify the Ed25519 signature over the canonical payload above;
4. verify the Runtime distribution contract;
5. only then replace the installed binary.

A missing, empty, whitespace-only, or divergent `signing_pubkey` is a hard failure,
as are missing/invalid signatures and checksum mismatches. `SIMPLICIO_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1`
may be used only with an explicit `SIMPLICIO_CHANNEL=unofficial` channel and never
bypasses any cryptographic failure on a stable signed release.

## Regression protection

The public repository keeps the verifier in `scripts/verify_ed25519.py`. The
following tests must remain green before publishing:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_verify_ed25519.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_release_provenance.py'
```

The fixture covers the real Runtime domain-separated payload and deliberately
rejects a raw digest signature. The release provenance gate also verifies the
cryptographic signature for every staged artifact whenever the manifest marks
signatures as required.

## Key rotation

The private Ed25519 signing key never belongs in this repository. Key rotation is a separate documented transition: update the schema and installers before accepting a new key, publish a new patch release, and never rewrite the bytes or assets of an immutable release.


## Incident evidence: v3.8.24

The public `v3.8.24` manifest had `security.signature_required=true` but no root `signing_pubkey`. The installer consequently reported a key mismatch instead of the specific missing-field error. The incident is preserved in `tests/fixtures/v3.8.24-manifest-missing-signing-pubkey.json`, and the regression test requires the missing-key path to remain fatal. Never rewrite the immutable `v3.8.24` assets; the correction belongs in a new patch release.
